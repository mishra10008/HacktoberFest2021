Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, M = 5
arr1[] = {1, 3, 5, 7}
arr2[] = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
Explanation: Since you can't use any 
extra space, modify the given arrays
to form 
arr1[] = {0, 1, 2, 3}
arr2[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, M = 3
arr1[] = {10, 12}
arr2[] = {5, 18, 20}
Output: 5 10 12 18 20
Explanation: Since you can't use any
extra space, modify the given arrays
to form 
arr1[] = {5, 10}
arr2[] = {12, 18, 20}
